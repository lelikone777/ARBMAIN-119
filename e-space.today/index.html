                    <h3>Price of the Services</h3>

                    <p>E-space offers its Users the chance to Service. Your mobile operator may charge additional browsing costs, independently from the services provided by E-space., for downloading products. E-space accepts no liability for the cost of browsing charged by the various mobile phone operators.Billing errors are handled by E-space after receiving information of such error from the User or other sources. E-space aims to rectify any billing errors in the shortest possible time, but it should not exceed 30 (thirty) calendar days. This time may be extended in exceptional circumstances, and E-space undertakes to keep the User informed, where possible and reasonable.Any refunds provided to Users are provided in the same currency that the Service is priced. Refunds should not cause the User any charges for such refund. In the event that the User incurs any charges for receiving a refund, such user should contact customer support as stated above in order to receive compensation for any bank charges incurred. Refunds are performed in reasonable time, but it should not exceed 30 (thirty) calendar days for E-space to form a decision on the refund and grounds for such refund and perform necessary actions. The refund is then processed and may be reflected on the User’s account shortly. E-space has no control over the duration of time necessary for the refund to be reflected on the User’s account.</p>



                    <h3>Regarding Users’ use of the Service</h3>

                    <p>Users must be adults of full legal age of 18 years old and up, with full legal capacity to use the Service. The responsibility for determining whether the User is an adult and has the right to use the Service is the responsibility of the User, and E-space shall not accept any liability, provided E-space stated all the necessary information on the front page of Service. Since the facts of underaged Users obtaining access to the Service may not be verified by E-space, E-space reminds parents and guardians of their responsibility for monitoring the use of the Services made by persons under their charge, particularly of the mobile phone being used for the Services and to which the minor or other third parties have access. E-space cannot control Users' use of the Services. It therefore does not warrant that the Services are used in accordance with applicable law or these General Conditions. It is up to the User to comply with these rules, particularly relating to intellectual and industrial property rights, abstaining from using the Services for unlawful purposes or in a way which is contrary to, or infringes, the rights and interests of E-space or third party rights holders. In addition, unless E-space has made a system expressly intended for that purpose available to Users, Users must not obtain or attempt to obtain any type of content on the Website, including, without limitation, text, graphics, drawings, sound files, images, photographs or videos. Specifically, E-space forbids any downloads copies or reproductions of content made by a User unless specifically permitted by E-space E-space accepts no liability for any loss or damage of any kind which may arise from use by Users of the Services and the contents offered on any E-space websites. E-space accepts no liability for any loss or damage of any kind which may arise from the use by Users of the Services provided by the Club and the contents offered on any E-space websites. E-space reminds the User that the general requirement is for the Users to be 18 years old to use the Service, but if the legislation of the User’s country of residence provides for older age of reaching adulthood and using the Service, the User shall abide by those rules instead.The Service must not be used to intentionally engage in illegal conduct, to knowingly create, store or disseminate any illegal content, to knowingly infringe copyright, to knowingly infringe any intellectual property rights, or to send spam or promote the sending of spam.</p>

                    <p>E-space also reminds the User that it’s User’s independent choice to use the Service, and by choosing to do so User bears all the responsibility to abide by the applicable laws, as well as to behave in accordance with moral, ethical and other social norms and standards. For the avoidance of doubt, E-space specifically points out that the Service must only be used with the permission of the bill-payer.</p>

                    <h3>Regarding the sending and receipt of the Service</h3>

                    <p>Services must be requested in accordance with the instructions communicated by E-space to Users and, in particular, must include the exact text stipulated by E-space for Service from time to time. Such instructions are publicly available on the website of the Service. In addition, in the case of Services requested by mobile phone, the User's handset must be compatible with, and have the technology required for, each Service. E-space accepts no liability for any requests which do not include the text stipulated for each Service or which originate from mobiles which are not compatible with the Services. In addition, E-space accepts no liability for any delays affecting the sending of contents to Users, or their quality, since such delays depend on factors completely beyond E-space's control, such as, among others, network traffic, the operators, the features of the various mobile phones, computers and/or computer tools, and the quality of the content itself. Notwithstanding the foregoing, E-space shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that content reaches Users at the time it is requested.</p>

                    <h3>Regarding mobile phone ownership</h3>

                    <p>By using any E-space mobile service, E-space only receives the mobile phone number associated to that service it is therefore unable to determine or control the identity of the User who is requesting the Service. The User warrants that he or she is the owner of the mobile phone from which the registration for the Service is applied for, or at least that he or she has the owner's authorisation to register with the Club. E-space accepts no liability where the User who has requested the Service is not the lawful owner of the mobile phone or lacks the owner's authority to use the mobile phone.</p>

                    <h3>Withdrawal of Content / Inappropriate Content</h3>

                    <p>E-space does not warrant the lawfulness, reliability or usefulness of messages, content or any other materials to which the User may have access in connection with the provision of the Services. Regardless of any methods which may be used by E-space to detect messages or content which are potentially unlawful or in breach of third party rights, if you believe that any of the messages or contents to which you have access through the Service infringe any third party rights or involve an infringement of current legislation, you can contact us by writing to E-space's registered address including the following details:</p>

                    <p>An express statement, signed by you, that the information supplied in the notification is accurate to the best of your knowledge.</p>

                    <p>E-space excludes all liability, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for any loss or damage of any kind which may be caused by any content and made available to Users being transmitted, disseminated, stored, made available, received, obtained or accessed, particularly but not exclusively for any loss or damage which may be caused by:</p>

                    <p>Infringement of the law, moral standards and generally accepted decency or public order by third parties</p>

                    <p>Infringement of intellectual and industrial property rights, business secrets, contractual obligations of any kind, people's right to personal and family privacy and image, right to protection of personal data, property rights and rights of any other nature belonging to a third party</p>

                    <p>The carrying out of acts of unfair competition and unlawful advertising</p>

                    <p>Unsuitability for any kind of purpose and the failure to meet expectations generated by the messages and/or content</p>

                    <h3>Faults and defects in any kind of content.</h3>

                    <p>E-space reserves the right at any time to reject or remove any content which is in breach of current legislation, these Service Terms and Conditions and any subsequent versions,as well as content that it considers illegal or for which it has received a take-down notice.</p>

                    <p>E-space may at any time and without prior warning suspend and/or unsubscribe from the Services any User whodoes not comply with these Service Terms and Conditions or any other related contractual obligations.</p>
